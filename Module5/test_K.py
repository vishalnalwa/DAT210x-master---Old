# What is the accuracy score of your KNeighbors Classifier when K=9 (Enter as a decimal)?
# I get 0.857142857143, but the "correct" answer is 0.871428571429; not sure if this is correct.

# Decrease K by 1 and record the new accuracy score. Keep doing this until you get down to, and including, K=1. Concerning the scores
# you saw:
# I was able to get an even higher reading, but overfit my data
